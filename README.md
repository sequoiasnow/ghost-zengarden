# Ghost Zengarden

This is a theme developed on the premise of a CSS Zengarden, almost all of the templating is forked from [the ghost starter](https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter). The only real change is the CSS, which is entirely custom and an effort to make a theme only document drive.


# Development

Styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# Install
yarn

# Run build & watch for changes
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
yarn zip
```
